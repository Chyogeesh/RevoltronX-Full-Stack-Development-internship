Approach to Building the Smart Yoga Products Website
1. Planning the Architecture
Frontend: Use Next.js for server-side rendering (SSR) and client-side navigation.
Backend: Use API routes in Next.js for handling CRUD operations.
Database: Use MongoDB (via Mongoose) for managing product and blog data.
Styling: Use Tailwind CSS for modern and responsive UI design.
Hosting: Deploy on Vercel for seamless integration with Next.js.
2. Feature Breakdown
1. Homepage:
UI/UX:
Attractive banner showcasing smart yoga products with a CTA ("Shop Now").
Sections for product highlights and testimonials.
SSR:
Pre-render homepage to optimize performance and SEO.
2. Product Page:
Listing Page:
Fetch product data using API routes.
Display products in a grid with image, title, price, and "View Details" button.
Detail Page:
Use Dynamic Routing (/products/[id]) for individual product details.
Allow users to add items to a cart (cart state managed via React Context).
3. Blog Section:
UI:
Simple list of blog previews (title, summary, and "Read More" link).
Detail Page:
Use Dynamic Routing (/blogs/[id]) for individual blog posts.
API Routes:
Provide endpoints to fetch blogs and individual articles.
4. Social Media Integration:
Use Instagram Graph API or an embeddable widget for recent posts.
Alternatively, fetch and display dummy posts for demonstration.
5. Admin Panel:
Protected Route (/admin):
Use NextAuth.js or custom authentication for admin login.
CRUD Functionality:
Add/Edit/Delete Products:
Form to upload product name, description, price, and image.
Use API routes to interact with the database.
Write/Edit/Delete Blog Articles:
WYSIWYG editor for blog content creation.
Manage publication status.
Update Social Media Links:
Form to store and update links in the database.
6. Optional: Analytics Overview:
Display basic stats:
Total products.
Total blog articles.
Graphs or summaries using libraries like Chart.js or Recharts.
3. Key Features to Highlight
Server-Side Rendering (SSR):
Use SSR for product and blog listing pages to improve SEO and load times.
Dynamic Routing:
Implement dynamic routes for product and blog detail pages.
API Routes:
/api/products for managing products.
/api/blogs for managing blog articles.
/api/admin for authentication.
5. Development Steps
Set Up Next.js Project:

Initialize with npx create-next-app.
Install dependencies: tailwindcss, mongoose, next-auth, axios.
Database Setup:

Connect to MongoDB using Mongoose.
Define models for Product and Blog.
API Development:

Create RESTful API routes for product and blog operations.
Frontend Development:

Build pages and components for the homepage, product listing, blog section, and admin panel.
Admin Authentication:

Implement basic authentication using NextAuth.js or custom middleware.
Testing and Deployment:

Test locally for functionality and responsiveness.
Deploy to Vercel and test live version.
6. Challenges and Solutions
SEO Optimization:
Leverage SSR for key pages to improve crawlability.
Dynamic Routing:
Use [id] routes to simplify scalability.
Admin Panel Security:
Protect admin routes with authentication and middleware.
7. Documentation
Provide:

Setup instructions (dependencies, database connection).
Explanation of design choices and Next.js features used.
Overview of challenges faced and solutions implemented.
8. Submission
Source Code: Include on GitHub or zip file.
Live Link: Hosted on Vercel.
Deadline: Ensure submission before November 17.
This plan ensures a scalable, performant, and feature-rich application, demonstrating modern web development best practices.
